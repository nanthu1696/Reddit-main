## Tech Stacks:
### React- Router:
 - The version of the React-router used in this application is 6.15.0(latest version).
 - React Router enables "client side routing". In traditional websites, the browser requests a document from a web server, downloads and evaluates CSS and JavaScript assets, and renders the HTML sent from the server. When the user clicks a link, it starts the process all over again for a new page.
 - Client side routing allows your app to update the URL from a link click without making another request for another document from the server. Instead, your app can immediately render some new UI and make data requests with fetch to update the page with new information.
 - This enables faster user experiences because the browser doesn't need to request an entirely new document or re-evaluate CSS and JavaScript assets for the next page. It also enables more dynamic user experiences with things like animation.
 - Client side routing is enabled by creating a Router and linking/submitting to pages with Link.
 - In this application Nested Routing is also implemented.
 - Nested Routing is the general idea of coupling segments of the URL to component hierarchy and data.
 - React Router's nested routes were inspired by the routing system in Ember.js circa 2014.

### React:
 - React, sometimes referred to as a frontend JavaScript framework, is a JavaScript library created by Facebook.
React is a tool for building UI components.
 - React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory. Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
 - React only changes what needs to be changed.  React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.
